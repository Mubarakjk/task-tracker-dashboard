# Task Tracker Dashboard

I built this **Task Tracker Dashboard** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

It lets you **add tasks, mark them as done, delete tasks**, and keeps track of progress. Tasks are saved in the browser using **LocalStorage**, so nothing gets lost when you close the page.  

This project helped me practice creating a **clean interface** and adding interactivity with JavaScript.

## Features
- Add tasks
- Complete tasks
- Delete tasks
- See total and completed tasks
- Data saved in the browser

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser  
2. Start adding tasks!
